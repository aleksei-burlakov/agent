# Web API

Trento exposes a web API, both for internal and public usage. All the available endpoints are defined and documented via the [OpenAPI 2.0 specification](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/) (a.k.a. Swagger).

Once the Trento Server is running, the automatically generated documentation page and the JSON specification can be browsed at `/api/docs/index.html` and `/api/docs/doc.json` respectively.

There might be some other API endpoints, which could be documented elsewhere for development purposes only, but please disregard any functionality that is not included in the above specification, as this would mean it is not intended for external usage.
